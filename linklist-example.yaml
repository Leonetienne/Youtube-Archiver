# This is an example linklist file, just to show the data structure.
# This structure is identical to the linklist-videos.yaml, and to the linklist-music.yaml files. (You have to create these yourself, in repository-root!)
# If this file is called linklist-videos.yaml, all entries would be downloaded as videos. If you'd call it linklist-music.yaml, all entries would be downloaded as mp3 files.

# Important logic:
#   - Entries are seperated via a single line containting "-".
#   - All entries MUST provide the member "url".
#   - An entry CAN specificy a "folder-name", but does not HAVE to. If not, the "folder-name" will default to a videos uploader. You might want to specify it for playlists!



# Let's look at a few simple entries:

# We want to download all the stuff of Eminem!
# Eminem
-
  url: https://www.youtube.com/c/eminem/videos
  folder-name: Eminem # We want to explicitly state the directory name, since the uploader is sometimes "Eminem" and sometimes "EminemVEVO". We want it all in one place!

# Let's also download all the stuff of DJ S3RL.
# Since S3RL does not do any of that VEVO bs, we can just let the folder-name default to the uploaders name.
# S3RL

# Let's say we have a playlist with stuff from a gazillion different uploaders.
# Letting the "folder-name" default, would wreak havoc upon the file-structure, since the playlist would be spread over a gazillion different directories, one for each uploader.
# So, let's again explicitly specify the directory name
# Snoop Dogg
