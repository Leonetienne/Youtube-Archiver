# What's the purpose of this? If you find a nice playlist, which won't ever update, why would you want to fetch it every time running the cronjob?
# Just adding it to a download list and running the cronjob is shit aswell, because fetching all the other items still takes time.
# This allows you to bypass ALL your other lists, to quickly and cleanly download a playlist (or multiple) **once**.
# This filename should be "once.yaml".

# All three attributes are REQUIRED!
